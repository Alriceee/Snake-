# Not your normal readme.md
## (clearly github removed my other releases. so it skips from 5.2 to 6.something to 6.3) <br/>

just shut up and download snake. <br/>

Please know how to run an html file. <br/>
used visual studio code + caret + npp (linux) to code. <br/>
shut up, stop reading, AND DOWNLOAD THE HTML FILE <br/>


*for the love of god if you don't know how to run an html file in your web browser, look it up*
