This has been a project sense what? 2017? 2018? I am very proud of how far snake became for me. <br/>
I really only got into coding because of something called "searchy web." It was used to bypass school restrictions lol. <br/>
If i find searchy web source code, ill upload it. maybe it'll work on replit. <br/>
But v6.3 will go to v7.0 then snake won't receive anymore major updates. Just bug fixes. <br/>
Like I said, a very fun project, but it's time to end it. Not many updates will be coming out.

*for the love of god if you don't know how to run an html file in your web browser, look it up*
