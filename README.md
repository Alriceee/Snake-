# Not your normal readme.md
## (clearly github removed my other releases. so it skips from 5.2 to 6.something to 6.3) <br/>
### I'll add christmas snake and stop removing it, it needs to stay tbh. (christmas snake will have snake color alternating between red and green.)
you thought this was a normal readme.md? <br/>
yeah your right. it probably is. To be honest, i'm mad at github for removing my other releases. <br/>
This has been a project sense what? 2017? 2018? I am very proud of how far snake became for me. <br/>
I really only got into coding because of something called "searchy web" (dead project, not even on google anymore.) It was a fun project to work on, and it was mainly ment for bypassing websites when I was ip banned for no reason. <br/>
But v6.3 will go to v7.0 then snake won't receive anymore major updates. Just bug fixes. <br/>
Like I said, a very fun project, but it's time to end it. Not many updates will be coming out.
