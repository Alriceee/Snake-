There isn't really a point of this, but you know? Who cares?

Update #1: Added Arrow Key support. (I know I kept putting this off but I finally did it)

Update #2: Added a link to this page, (If it's not the raw data, email me at isaiah.lowder1@outlook.com)

Update #3: Decided that this is the final version, and it was great making this game.
