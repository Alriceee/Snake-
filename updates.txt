Working on a christmas update, (will still have the original version as well.)

Yes I skipped thanksgiving and halloween, I didn't feel like doing anything for those.

Christmas Theme will have a new wall option, (hopefully the wall color can be 2 colors at once.)

The snake and apple will be 2 different colors this time, I may end up putting that update in the original version.
